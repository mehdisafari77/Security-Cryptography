The city of Atlanta, Georgia was the subject of a ransomware attack which began in March 2018. The city recognized the attack on Thursday, March 22, 2018, and publicly acknowledged it was a ransomware attack. politics and money. Rising international tensions have led to more politically motivated attacks, as the skyrocketing trend of government-targeted attacks indicates. This was one of the most sustained and consequential cyberattacks ever mounted against a major American city. Threat researchers at Dell SecureWorks, the Atlanta-based security firm helping the city respond to the ransomware attack, identified the assailants as the SamSam hacking crew, one of the more prevalent and meticulous of the dozens of active ransomware attack groups. The SamSam group is known for choosing targets that are the most likely to accede to its high ransom demands — typically the Bitcoin equivalent of about $50,000 — and for finding and locking up the victims’ most valuable data. The city has worked with Dell SecureWorks and Cisco Security to help fix the tech flaws.
